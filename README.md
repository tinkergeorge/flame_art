# Flame Art

This repository is software for the Light Curve project,
a 30 sided object with fire jets.

# Run the simulator

[Install Rust if you don't have it.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```
cd sim
cargo run
```

The simulator takes over the artnet port.

# Run a test program

Make sure python is a recent version, and `pip install importlib`

```
cd flame_test
python flame_test.py -c sim_test.cnf
```

This runs a basic test pattern (pulse). Please see the help ( python flame_test.py --help )
and the readme in that directory.
